This pythone code is a parser that reads the valid mathematical expressions from a file and generates a parse tree for them. The expressions can be split across multiple lines and can contain white spaces between tokens.
The Node class defines a node in the parse tree. Each node has a symbol attribute that holds the symbol represented by the node, and leftChild and rightChild attributes that hold the left and right children of the node.
